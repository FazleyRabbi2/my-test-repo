        <h3>Chandrayaan-3
        </h3>
        <p>Chandrayaan-3 (transl. Moon-craft, pronunciation (help·info)) is the third    Indian lunar exploration
        mission under the Indian Space Research Organisation's (ISRO) Chandrayaan programme. It consists of a
        lander named Vikram and a rover named Pragyan, similar to those of the Chandrayaan-2 mission. The propulsion
        module carried the lander and rover configuration to lunar orbit in preparation for a powered descent by the
        lander.

        Chandrayaan-3 was launched on 14 July 2023. The lander and rover landed at the lunar south pole
        region on 23 August 2023 at 18:02 IST, making India the first country to successfully land a spacecraft
        near the lunar south pole and the fourth country to soft-land on the Moon.</p>
        <h3>Objectives</h3>
        <p>ISRO's mission objectives for the Chandrayaan-3 mission were:
            <br>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Getting a lander to land safely and softly on the surface of the Moon.</li>
                <li>Getting a lander to land safely and softly on the surface of the Moon.</li>
                <li>Conducting and observing experiments on the materials available on the lunar surface to better understand the composition of the Moon.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>On 23 August 2023, as the lander approached the low point of its orbit, its four engines fired as a braking manoeuvre at 30 kilometres (19 mi) above the Moon's surface. After 11.5 minutes, the lander was 7.2 km (4.5 miles) above the surface; it maintained this altitude for about 10 seconds, then stabilized itself using eight smaller thrusters and rotated from a horizontal to a vertical position while continuing its descent.</p>
